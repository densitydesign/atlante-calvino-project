We have been granted free use of the digital format by Mondadori in order to compile the datasets used to create the visualizations. Whenever the visualization is based on a selection of works, it is clearly stated.</9><p>Although this has been a cooperative work, each of the three researchers of the University of Geneva’s literature team has specifically developed one itinerary, as follows:</p><11><strong>Doubt itinerary</strong>: Margherita Parigini<br/><strong>Space itinerary</strong>: Virginia Giustetto<br/><strong>Form itinerary</strong>: Valeria Cavalloro</11><p>The Atlas was written in Italian and then translated into English in order to provide a double version. Concerning the titles, we decided to always maintain the original version. As for the quotes from other critical works, unless the source material is listed in English, the translation is ours.</p></0>"
