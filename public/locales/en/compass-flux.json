  "blocco_testo_1": "<p>The visualization reconstructs the publishing history of Italo Calvino’s short stories, which were often first published in newspapers and magazines and were later gathered into collections. Calvino wrote short stories over the course of his entire career: they are the very backbone of his body of work. The newspapers and magazines that first published most of Calvino’s short stories are listed on the left. During the twentieth century they largely contributed to the success of short stories.</p><p>In Calvino’s writing, individual short stories gain even more meaning once they are placed inside a collection (collections are listed on the right), thanks to their being combined and recombined with other texts, as collections were often reorganized. So, the flow of an individual short story could undergo many different publications.</p><2>There are three great families of short story anthologies: <2>Racconti</2>, the <4>Cosmicomiche</4> and <6>Palomar</6>.</2>",
