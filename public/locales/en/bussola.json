  "testo_bussola": "To begin this journey, you will need a <strong>compass</strong>. It is represented by three guide visualizations, always readily available to help you move through the author’s body of work: <i>Time and Works</i>, <i>Flows of the Stories</i> and <i>The Archipelago of Names</i>. They provide an overall view of the publishing history of the volumes, that of the short stories, and the author’s mental library.",
  "i_flussi_dei_racconti": "Flows of the Stories",
  "flussi_testo": "The short stories are the backbone of Calvino’s writing. For this reason, we arranged the over two hundred titles in a long list that allows the user to reconstruct the flow of the short stories’ publishing history in one visualization: from the first publication in newspapers or magazines, to the collection in volumes and to the various reorganisations the latter undergo over time.",
  "il_tempo_e_le_opere": "Time and Works",
  "tempo_testo": "This is a concise map that follows the development of Calvino’s four-decade-long literary career, showing the most important turning points in his publishing history: the main volumes and his cooperation with periodicals and newspapers. The organisation by genres allows the user to follow the fluctuation between short and long form, the experiments on structure, and the troubled development of the writing in search of its own right form.",
  "l_arcipelago_dei_nomi": "The Archipelago of Names",
  "testo_arcipelago": "Our analysis is limited to the narrative works, it will not extend to the essays; however, they will still remain in the background, like an archipelago of islands big and small. With this visualization, we suggest you circumnavigate them to get a sense of Calvino’s mental library: here you will find almost two thousand names, quoted in the great number of essays and articles published by the author in forty years and gathered together to pave the way for a new exploration."
