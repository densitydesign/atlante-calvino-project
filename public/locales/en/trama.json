    "come_funziona": "<p>This visualization is organized so as to offer two different reading modes.</p><p>On the first one, the front view on the lines shows a comparison between all the plots from Calvino’s texts in a uniform space, independent of their length. The horizontal development of each line is based on a scan of the time of the story, so it matches the storyline as it happens in the actual text, without taking into consideration either flashbacks or anticipations. By interacting with the view or using the search by title, it is possible to highlight one or more lines, and by moving a cursor along them, the user can read the names of the sequences in which they are divided. Each line can also be visualized singularly by clicking on its title tag on the right, in order to properly analyse every point of its narrative structure.\n\n\n<p>The option <i>Rotate view</i> grants access to a different mode: the entire visualization makes a 90° turn on itself, showing a side view, a perspective that highlights the vertical reach of the lines, based on the interval between their lowest and highest points. This view shows which part of the list of literary motifs was involved in Calvino’s engineering of each plot. The two geometric symbols on each line mark the opening and ending sequences respectively, granting a comprehensive view on the literary motifs the author chose as incipit and ending of his works.</p><p>In both modes it is always possible to visualize the sequence list, which can also be used as an investigation tool to analyse the visualizations: the user can select a specific interval and verify which plots, if any, coincide precisely with the chosen borders.</p>",
    "qualche_pista_di_lettura": "<p>Both reading modes available in this visualization allow the user to dive into Calvino’s plots and storylines and reveal many remarkable features.</p><p>One example in the front view is the use of the cursor on two or more highlighted lines: through this instrument it is possible to detect potential concurrences and differences between the texts’ structures, such as the presence of the same sequence in the same position in stories of different literary genre or written many years apart; or, conversely, the inconsistency between stories which, at a glance, seem to share a strong narrative similarity.</p><p>On the other hand, the side view creates a visual report of an issue that was strongly felt by Calvino: that of <i>Beginning</i> and <i>Ending</i>. Through the redistribution of lines we can see not only a summary of Calvino’s choices on the best ways to begin or end a story, but also a general view on the plots’ overall tendency: knowing that the sequences are arranged according to their potential influence on the narrative’s entropy, we can use the beginning-end markers to immediately deduce whether the plot of a story ends at a more or less dynamic stage, namely, in a situation of greater or lesser imbalance, compared to its beginning.\n</p>",
